üöÄ Projects

1. Predict Health Costs with Regression

Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict health insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
- Utilized Dropout layers for regularization and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the model.
- Achieved an MAE of under 3500, successfully passing the challenge requirements.
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas

2. SMS Spam Detection

Developed a Logistic Regression model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using a TF-IDF Vectorizer.

- Processed the dataset to extract features and labels, and trained the model to achieve high accuracy.
- Implemented a function to predict whether a message is spam based on its text.
- Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression

3. Book Recommendation System with KNN

Created a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend books based on user ratings, utilizing the Book-Crossings dataset.

- Modeled user interactions and calculated similarity between books using the cosine distance metric.
- Implemented a recommendation function to provide book suggestions based on user input.
- Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nearest Neighbors

4. Cat vs Dog Image Classification

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.

- Utilized ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and applied MaxPooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of image data.
- Achieved over 63% accuracy in correctly classifying images in the challenge.
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, ImageDataGenerator, Matplotlib
